                <p>Henry Fuseli's "The Nightmare" (1781) is one of his most iconic paintings, renowned for its haunting imagery and exploration of the subconscious. It depicts a woman sprawled across a bed, seemingly in deep sleep or unconscious, with a menacing incubus perched on her chest. The woman's twisted posture and the incubus' sinister expression create tension and unease.</p>
                <p>In the background, a dark horse with glowing eyes emerges from the shadows, adding to the eerie atmosphere. Fuseli's masterful use of chiaroscuro—strong contrasts between light and dark—heightens the drama and emotional impact.</p>
                <p>"The Nightmare" is often interpreted as a visualization of sleep paralysis, where individuals wake up but are unable to move, often experiencing hallucinations. Fuseli's fascination with the supernatural and the darker aspects of human psychology is evident in this work. The painting remains a powerful symbol of the fears and mysteries within the human mind.</p>
